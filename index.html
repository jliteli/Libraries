                                                Looking back three decades ago, it is evident that the world has changed drastically. With the boom of technology in the 1990s, most people have become dependent on it. Due to this boom globally, the library systems have had to change drastically and very quickly. With this change came new ideas, new format, new structures for how a library would function in a society.  From those effects came new technological advancements, through hardware, software, and digital resources. Gone were the traditional ways and the modern ways made their entrance. However, even with the willing change from some libraries to follow the societal norms of technology and it’s dependency on it, there is a key element library systems are missing. It is a fact that there are few people of the newer generations who know, understand, or could even be bothered with accessing the information and resources libraries have to offer. The next task of the library industry is to make their provided information less confusing by simplifying it, more accessible by showing students how to find things on their own, and lastly more appealing by introducing a social interaction component to keep the technological dependent world’s attention.

                                                It's changes do much over the years I’ve been working- it started out you wouldn’t believe what we used to do- all of this command line searching and now everything is on google and it seems very simple but there are still a lot of resources that are not digitized there’s still a lot of things that you’ll still need to go to the paper copy- we’re just trying to help people understand there’s only a limited amount of resources besides the internet. Sometimes I feel like I’ve been here for so long like here I am again but it’s not about the library, it’s just about working in the same place for so long- I’m the kind of person that likes to move around. There’s always something different- you never know what you’re going to do when you walk in this morning. So there’s always some new questions and interests and projects that come up. It's never a boring place, there are always interesting things to do. I like the windows a big fan of the windows but they’re actually problematic in libraries. If you leave paper out in the sun it starts to turn brown and brittle so basically we have a large amount of books sitting in the sunlight and that’s really not a good thing. I mean it's good for people working and stuff but it’s problematic for the space it is. If you think about the millions of dollars we put into the library it's not a good thing. Something you don’t know is that the main libraries (hill and hunt) do a lot of work for us. We are part of the whole ncsu library system. When I say i order books it means I send them a list of books and they order them for me, I don’t sit there and order stuff through amazon but we have all these procedures set up with access services whether they would go out and buy everything- there’s a hug department over there and all they do is buy stuff for the library and manage that process and then it goes and everything gets cataloged so there’s all these people over there that work behind the scenes and by the time they’ve taken care of it and ordered it and paid it and processed it and put the stickers on it and brought it over here.

Masterpieces, it’s like a chair. Were dope and they’re awesome to sit in and go sit in them for a long period of time and then i'll answer your questions and think of how many people get to sit in that expective chair that they wouldn’t have originally had that experience bc who buys 3,000 chairs. It has a good variety of spaces and you can find different environments for your mood like if you don’t wanna collaborated with anyone you can go to the wood room and no one is paying attention to anything but if you wanna just be really loud you can go to the learning commons and just talk your ass off and then there’s the fishbowl which is a happy medium where you can do your work but talk and collabo. You can do whatever you want. They have the hill of beans here which is a huge plus because they have the best coffee.

                                               It is a lot smaller obviously but that’s just because it's just design so it’s more specific and that makes sense but it would be cool if there were more places but I don’t know how busy this library gets. The lighting is nice and my apartment is dark and it’s nice there’s a spotlight so I don’t get this weird shadow when I’m drawing and you can't see it- so that’s one thing and when it’s sunny I bet it's a lot nicer.
